# Remime iOS ‚è∞

An easy and efficient way to manage your time on iOS! 
Its my first ever react native application!
(Uses catppuccin!)
written with ‚ù§Ô∏è  in [react-Native](https://reactnative.dev/) and [expo](https://expo.dev/) :)

Its for the event called [cider](https://cider.hackclub.com) organised by [Hackclub](https://hackclub.com)!
Thank you so much [@Mohammed](https://github.com/thedev132) , [@gaurav](https://github.com/yednapg) and [@faisal](https://github.com/faisalsayed10) for organizing this event!

> [!NOTE]
> This application is still under development, due to school examinations, I am not able to add all the features that I thought of, a huge customizability feature will be added in the next update!

## Features üòé

- A Pomodoro mode
- Modes include: Stopwatch, Clock, Timer, and Pomodoro
- Extremely simple, and straight-forward UI

## How does it work?

It uses react native and expo for everything. The quotes are just a few that I manually added, will add a databse for them, or will use some APIs in the future.

## How is it different from other time applications?

It uses catppuccin! I couldn't find any application on the appstore that's based on this colorscheme and looks minimal. I tried to make it as minimal and simple as possible..

## To-Do üõ†Ô∏è
